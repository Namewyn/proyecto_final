abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.The knowledge about the diffuse axonal injury (DAI) as a clinicopathological entity has matured in the last 30 years. It has been defined clinically (immediate and prolonged unconsciousness leading to death or severe disability) and pathologically (the triad of DAI specific changes). In terms of its biomechanics, DAI is occurring as a result of acceleration forces of longer duration and has been fully reproduced experimentally. In the process of diagnosing DAI, the performance of a complete forensic neuropathological examination is essential and the immunohistochemistry method using antibodies against $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein ($\beta$-APP) has been proved to be highly sensitive and specific, selectively targeting the damaged axons. In this review, we are pointing to the significant characteristics of DAI as a distinct clinicopathological entity that can cause severe impairment of the brain function, and in the forensic medicine setting, it can be found as the concrete cause of death. We are discussing not only its pathological feature, its mechanism of occurrence, and the events on a cellular level but also the dilemmas about DAI that still exist in science: (1) regarding the strict criteria for its diagnosis and (2) regarding its biomechanical significance, which can be of a big medicolegal importance.},

This review examines the complex pathophysiology and biomechanics of both types of neurotrauma and assesses the macroscopic and histologic features of component lesions, which may be used to determine the cause and manner of death resulting from an intentional assault or accident. Estimation of the survival time postinjury by pathologic examination is also important where malicious head injury is suspected, in an attempt to ascertain a time at which the traumatic event might have been committed, thereby evaluating the authenticity of statements made by the alleged perpetrator.},

abstract = {Objective: This article reviews the mechanisms and pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Research on the pathophysiology of diffuse and focal TBI is reviewed with an emphasis on damage that occurs at the cellular level. The mechanisms of injury are discussed in detail including the factors and time course associated with mild to severe diffuse injury as well as the pathophysiology of focal injuries. Examples of electrophysiologic procedures consistent with recent theory and research evidence are presented. Results: Acceleration/deceleration (A/D) forces rarely cause shearing of nervous tissue, but instead, initiate a pathophysiologic process with a well defined temporal progression. The injury foci are considered to be diffuse trauma to white matter with damage occurring at the superficial layers of the brain, and extending inward as A/D forces increase. Focal injuries result in primary injuries to neurons and the surrounding cerebrovasculature, with secondary damage occurring due to ischemia and a cytotoxic cascade. A subset of electrophysiologic procedures consistent with current TBI research is briefly reviewed. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of TBI occurs over time, in a pattern consistent with the physics of injury. The development of electrophysiologic procedures designed to detect specific patterns of change related to TBI may be of most use to the neurophysiologist. Significance: This article provides an up-to-date review of the mechanisms and pathophysiology of TBI and attempts to address misconceptions in the existing literature. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {The diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury (DAI), which may be of considerable importance in forensic medicine, necessitates widespread sampling of the brain for his-tology. Because a limited sampling method for screening brains for axonal damage would be of value for medico-legal work, the authors have tested the findings of an earlier study which suggested that a standard set of three blocks from above and below the tentorium could reliably be used in routine practice as a basis for the diagnosis of DAI. A series of 22 previously diagnosed cases of DAI, with a range of survival times, was studied using immunohistochemistry with antibodies to -amyloid precursor protein (APP), the microglial-associated antigen CD68 (PG-M1) and for GFAP. Strict histological criteria were used to assess traumatic dam-age, and the evolution of the histological changes with increasing survival is described. In four cases, the sampling scheme employed yielded evidence of axonal damage in only one block, and a diagnosis of DAI could have been made in only 13/22 cases. In six of the shortest surviving cases, APP positivity in the corpus callosum and brainstem outlined areas of early ischaemia, as well as of traumatic damage, so that interpretation of immunolabelling was not always clear-cut. The findings suggest that DAI cannot be reliably diagnosed on a restricted number of blocks from vulner-able areas, and that the use of APP and PG-M1 immunocytochemistry may bring interpretative prob-lems that can only be resolved by taking a larger series of tissue samples for histology.},

abstract = {Axonal pathology is increasingly identified by $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein ($\beta$APP) immunohistochemistry in the brains of patients who may or may not have a history of trauma. The presence of $\beta$APP-IR+ has been variously interpreted as either that diffuse traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is indeed a universal finding in cases of fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI) or there are other causes of $\beta$APP-IR+ axons which under certain circumstances may be sufficient to mimic TBI and therefore make the medico-legal interpretation of certain cases very difficult. To address some of the uncertainties we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the amount and distribution of $\beta$APP immunohistochemistry in 63 cases of fatal TBI, 17 cases of patients dying after cardiac arrest, 12 cases dying in association with status epilepticus, 3 cases of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, 13 cases of hypoglycaemia and in 60 controls. Three patterns of $\beta$APP-IR+ were identified. First, diffuse multi-focal, second, corresponding to the outline of an infarct or haematoma, and thirdly a mixture of the two. The first pattern was seen in cases of the lesser grades of TAI, CO poisoning, and hypoglycaemia, the second pattern in cases in which there was evidence of raised intracranial pressure and the third in cases of severe TAI. It is concluded that the proper interpretation of cases requires the examination of a sufficient number of blocks (n=15), processing using standardised protocols including $\beta$APP immunohistochemistry and in some cases the mapping of any IR + on anatomical line diagrams. $\beta$APP carried out on a small number of randomly taken blocks is likely to lead to misinterpretation of the clinico-pathological correlations and possibly to a miscarriage of justice. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Immunohistochemistry staining for $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein ($\beta$-APP) is a sensitive method to detect early axonal damage in traumatic brain injury, which was previously estimated to be of minimum 60-90 min after head injury. We present seven cases of well-documented posttraumatic survival of 35-60 min where $\beta$-APP detects early axonal damage. Cases were selected from routine work where documentation about survival is judged to be accurate. These are divided into three groups: group 1: severe head injury (n = 7) with documented survival between 35 and 60 min. Group 2: severe head injury (n = 4) with documented survival of less than 30 min. Group 3: cases (n = 4) where death was not due to head injury but survival is documented between 45 and 109 min. The brains were fixed in formalin for 4 weeks and six regions (frontal lobe with anterior corpus callosum, parietal lobe with deep white matter, basal ganglia with posterior limb of internal capsule, cerebellum with white matter and middle cerebellar peduncle and pons with basis pontis and superior cerebellar peduncle) were sampled. All blocks were stained for haematoxylin and eosin and $\beta$-APP and selected ones for CD68, using antigen retrieval method. In group 1 sections revealed $\beta$-APP immunoreactivity in forms of small globules and granules and occasionally as t hin and short filaments. These were detected in the pons, corpus callosum, internal capsule and cerebral white matter, with some variation in localization and intensity. In groups 2 and 3 all the sections were negative for $\beta$-APP staining. None of the cases showed evidence of severe brain swelling, increased intracranial pressure, ischaemia or infection. Using the antigen retrieval method, $\beta$-APP immunohistochemistry can detect axonal damage within 35 min after severe head injury. These results may have an implication in the consideration of minimal survival time after traumatic head injury in medico-legal practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the past 70. years, diffuse axonal injury (DAI) has emerged as one of the most common and important pathological features of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Axons in the white matter appear to be especially vulnerable to injury due to the mechanical loading of the brain during TBI. As such, DAI has been found in all severities of TBI and may represent a key pathologic substrate of mild TBI (concussion). Pathologically, DAI encompasses a spectrum of abnormalities from primary mechanical breaking of the axonal cytoskeleton, to transport interruption, swelling and proteolysis, through secondary physiological changes. Depending on the severity and extent of injury, these changes can manifest acutely as immediate loss of consciousness or confusion and persist as coma and/or cognitive dysfunction. In addition, recent evidence suggests that TBI may induce long-term neurodegenerative processes, such as insidiously progressive axonal pathology. Indeed, axonal degeneration has been found to continue even years after injury in humans, and appears to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease-like pathological changes. Here we review the current understanding of DAI as a uniquely mechanical injury, its histopathological identification, and its acute and chronic pathogenesis following TBI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The CNS is a complex organ and its examination requires special methods and knowledge and often consultation with a neuropathologist. The prerequisite for the proper examination is correct handling and processing of the CNS. Because of its soft consistency fixation of the CNS in toto before detailed macroscopic analysis is recommended but guidance for an expedited limited examination is also given. The key features to which attention should be paid during the removal and later macroscopic examination of the CNS are described. Processing CNS for microscopy also requires special techniques and in addition to the routine stains both special histological and selected immunohistochemical stainings are often needed to reach the correct diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This article aims to review the existing knowledge on the mechanism of cranial blunt force injuries and the associated fracture patterns in order to facilitate the interpretation of such injuries in skeletonized or heavily decomposed bodies where soft tissue is no longer available. Current developments on theory and practice are also discussed. Despite the evidenced progress made in the past decades, trauma analysis in medicolegal settings remains a very challenging task, especially in the absence of soft tissue. It is thus imperative to work toward developing repeatable and scientifically acceptable methods with known error rates, in order to meet the increasing demands of the judicial system on the admissibility of evidence and expert witness testimony.

The case material consisted of cases of fatal nonmissile closed-head injury (n5119), gunshot injury (n530), fatal cerebral ischemia / hypoxia (n551), brain death caused by mechanical trauma (n514) or nonmechanical injury (n518), and acute hemorrhagic shock (n520).

A statistically significant difference between traumatically and nontraumatically induced (nondisruptive) AI was not found. There was no statistical evidence of a correlation between AI and the different types of external force, since AI could be demonstrated after both acceleration / deceleration injuries and traumatic impact. Therefore, biomechanical inferences for reconstruction purposes are not possible. On the other hand, b-APP was found to be a definite marker of vitality.

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of disability, and at present, there is no universally accepted treatment. The functional decline following SCI is contributed to both direct mechanical injury and secondary pathophysiological mechanisms that are induced by the initial trauma. These mechanisms initially involve widespread haemorrhage at the site of injury and necrosis of central nervous system (CNS) cellular components. At later stages of injury, the cord is observed to display reactive gliosis. The actions of astrocytes as well as numerous other cells in this response create an environment that is highly nonpermissive to axonal regrowth. Also manifesting important effects is the immune system. The early recruitment of neutrophils and at later stages, macrophages to the site of insult cause exacerbation of injury. However, at more chronic stages, macrophages and recruited T helper cells may potentially be helpful by providing trophic support for neuronal and non-neuronal components of the injured CNS. Within this sea of injurious mechanisms, the oligodendrocytes appear to be highly vulnerable. At chronic stages of SCI, a large number of oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis at sites that are distant to the vicinity of primary injury. This leads to denudement of axons and deterioration of their conductive abilities, which adds significantly to functional decline. By indulging into the molecular mechanisms that cause oligodendrocyte apoptosis and identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention, the prevention of this apoptotic wave will be of tremendous value to individuals living with SCI. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The neuropathologist involved in forensic work is not uncommonly confronted with a case in which there is no or only a limited history or, if available, the information is uncertain or is often conflicting. In recent years the immunohistochemical stain beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) has been used to assess the extent of axonal injury in a variety of pathological processes but in forensic practice is of greatest utility in the assessment of traumatic brain injury. Diffuse traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in humans has been demonstrated by beta-APP immunoreactivity in patients surviving at least 2 h after head injury. However, many of these patients also have an associated ischaemic injury, either focal or diffuse, which may make the interpretation of beta-APP immunoreactivity difficult. The present study was designed to evaluate if the published descriptions of the different morphological patterns and distributions of beta-APP immunoreactive axons could be used to microscopically distinguish axonal injury attributed to trauma from other causes. To test this hypothesis a total of 73 cases were reviewed. The cases were selected from six different groups based on clinical information. Immunostained sections from each case were assessed 'blind' to the clinical history, and the microscopic pattern and distribution of beta-APP positive axons were recorded. Haematoxylin and eosin (H+E) stained sections were then reviewed for each case and a final pathological diagnosis was recorded and compared to the clinical history. 62/73 (85{\%}) cases were correctly correlated with the clinical history and in particular 14/17 (82{\%}) cases of TAI were correctly identified. These findings indicate that the published microscopic patterns of the distribution of beta-APP positive axons in TAI and in diffuse ischaemic injury can be used, in conjunction with microscopy of H+E stained sections to determine the cause of axonal pathology in most cases.},

@article{Smith2003,
abstract = {Background: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is one of the most common and important pathologic features of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The susceptibility of axons to mechanical injury appears to be due to both their viscoelastic properties and their high organization in white matter tracts. Although axons are supple under normal conditions, they become brittle when exposed to rapid deformations associated with brain trauma. Accordingly, rapid stretch of axons can damage the axonal cytoskeleton resulting in a loss of elasticity and impairment of axoplasmic transport. Sub-sequent swelling of the axon occurs in discrete bulb formations or in elongated varicosities that accumulate transported proteins. Calcium entry into damaged axons is thought to initiate further damage by the activation of proteases. Ultimately, swollen axons may become disconnected and contribute to additional neuropathologic changes in brain tissue. DAI may largely account for the clinical manifestations of brain trauma. However, DAI is extremely difficult to detect noninvasively and is poorly defined as clinical syndrome. Conclusions: Future advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of DAI will be dependent on our collective understanding of injury biomechanics, temporal axonal pathophysiology, and its role in patient outcome.},

abstract = {Cell death after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of neurological deficits and mortality. Understanding the mechanisms of delayed post-traumatic cell loss may lead to new therapies that improve outcome. Although TBI induces changes in multiple cell types, mechanisms of neuronal cell death have been the predominant focus. Recent work has emphasized the diversity of neuronal death phenotypes, which have generally been defined by either morphological or molecular changes. This diversity has led to confusing and at times contradictory nomenclature. Here we review the historical basis of proposed definitions of neuronal cell death, with the goal of clarifying critical research questions and implications for therapy in TBI. We believe that both morphological and molecular features must be used to clarify post-traumatic cell death and related therapeutic targets. Further, we underscore that the most effective neuroprotective strategies will need to target multiple pathways to reflect the regional and temporal changes underlying diverse neuronal cell death phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.},

abstract = {Deaths due to blunt force trauma to the head as a result of assault are some of the most common cases encountered by the practicing forensic pathologist. Previous studies have shown inflicting injury to the head region is one of the most effective methods of murder. The important factors that determine severity of trauma include the type of weapon used, type and site of skull fracture, intracranial haemorrhage and severity of brain injury. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of blunt force trauma to the skull produced by different instruments. Nine adult monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) skulls were used as models. Commonly found blunt objects comprising of Warrington hammer, hockey stick and open face helmet were used in this study. A machine calibrated force generator was used to hold the blunt object in place and to hit the skulls at forces of 12.5N and 25N. Resultant traumatic effects and fractures (linear, depressed, basilar, comminuted, and distastic) were analyzed according to type of blunt object used; surface area of contact and absolute force (N/cm(2)) delivered. Results showed that all investigated instruments were capable of producing similar injuries. The severity of trauma was not related to the surface area of contact with the blunt objects. However, only high absolute forces produced comminuted fractures. These findings were observational, as the samples were too small for statistical conclusions.},

abstract = {An inception cohort of 40 children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury and suspected diffuse axonal injury were studied using a new high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility-weighted technique that is very sensitive for hemorrhage. A blinded comparison was performed between the extent of parenchymal hemorrhage and initial clinical variables as well as outcomes measured at 6 to 12 months after injury. Children with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores ({\textless} or =8, n = 30) or prolonged coma ({\textgreater}4 days, n = 20) had a greater average number (p = 0.007) and volume (p = 0.008) of hemorrhagic lesions. Children with normal outcomes or mild disability (n = 30) at 6 to 12 months had, on average, fewer hemorrhagic lesions (p = 0.003) and lower volume (p = 0.003) of lesions than those who were moderately or severely disabled or in a vegetative state. Significant differences also were observed when comparing regional injury to clinical variables. Because susceptibility-weighted imaging is much more sensitive than conventional T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury, more accurate and objective assessment of injury can be obtained early after insult, and may provide better prognostic information regarding duration of coma as well as long-term outcome.},
